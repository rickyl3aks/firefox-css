# Firefox CSS Styling

## Setup

To enable custom CSS in Firefox:

- Open Firefox and type `about:config`
- Search for `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` and set it to `true`
- Navigate to `about:profiles` to access your Firefox profile directory
- Open the directory and create a folder named `chrome` if it doesn't already exist. Alternatively, you can copy the contents of this repository and paste it into your profile directory to enable custom CSS styling
